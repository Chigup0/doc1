## 3. Key Components and Technologies

### 3.1 **Frontend (Next.js)**

- **Next.js** powers the frontend, providing **server-side rendering** (SSR) and **static site generation** (SSG) for fast page loading and SEO benefits.
- **React** is used for building reusable components and managing the state.
- The frontend interacts with the **FastAPI backend** through **RESTful APIs** using **Axios**.
- **File upload** functionality is handled through HTML5 and custom components for managing file previews.

**Technologies**:
- **Next.js**: For dynamic web applications with React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first CSS design.
- **Axios**: For API communication between the frontend and backend.

### 3.2 **Backend (FastAPI)**

The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, providing **high-performance API handling**. It serves multiple roles, including user authentication, file upload handling, and interaction with the AI pipeline.

- **File Management**: When a file is uploaded, FastAPI handles the storage in **AWS S3** and the insertion of metadata in **PostgreSQL**.
- **AI Integration**: FastAPI manages the communication between the **AI layer** and the frontend.
- **Authentication**: Users are authenticated using **JWT tokens** to ensure secure access.

**Technologies**:
- **FastAPI**: Fast and modern Python web framework for API handling.
- **Python-Jose**: For JWT authentication and token management.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **boto3**: AWS SDK for managing file storage in S3.

### 3.3 **File Storage with AWS S3**

AWS S3 is used to store files securely. It offers **scalable storage** and integrates well with FastAPI to handle file uploads and downloads.

- **File Upload**: When a user uploads a file, it is stored in an **S3 bucket**. The file metadata (file name, size, type, and user ID) is stored in the **PostgreSQL** database for easy reference.
- **File Retrieval**: Files are retrieved from S3 whenever needed, with access control managed via **AWS IAM**.

**Technologies**:
- **AWS S3**: Scalable object storage.
- **boto3**: Python SDK for AWS services.

### 3.4 **PostgreSQL for Credentials and Metadata**

PostgreSQL is used to store user credentials, file metadata, and other relational data. It ensures the integrity of the data and allows for fast lookups and queries.

- **User Management**: Stores user credentials (hashed passwords) and user metadata.
- **File Metadata**: Stores details about files such as file names, types, sizes, and storage paths (links to S3).
- **Data Relationships**: Although PostgreSQL is a relational database, it is used here to store **basic metadata** and user data in structured tables.

**Technologies**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for secure, structured data storage.

### 3.5 **Graph-Based AI Pipeline (Neo4j)**

The AI layer in **TheDrive** uses **Neo4j**, a **graph database**, to manage and analyze the relationships between different files and metadata. This is crucial for implementing the **AI-powered features** such as **semantic search** and **file cross-referencing**.

- **Graph Representation**: The AI pipeline treats files, metadata, and other entities as nodes in a graph, with relationships (edges) between them. For example, files that share tags or concepts are connected in the graph.
- **AI Features**: Graph-based models allow for advanced queries such as "find all files related to this topic" or "retrieve files linked by similar keywords." It also powers **semantic search**, allowing the system to understand the context of search queries.
- **AI Processing**: The AI pipeline uses **machine learning models** to analyze textual content (e.g., for summarization) and images (via **OCR** and **computer vision models**).

**Technologies**:
- **Neo4j**: Graph database used to manage file relationships and metadata.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms such as **community detection** and **graph traversal** to analyze relationships between files.

### 3.6 **AI Layer**

The **AI layer** performs several tasks, including:

- **Text Analysis**: Utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models to extract meaning from documents, such as **summarization**, **keyword extraction**, and **contextual analysis**.
- **Image Processing**: Uses **OCR** to extract text from images and applies **image recognition models** to understand visual data (e.g., charts, graphs, diagrams).
- **Semantic Search**: Enhances search by understanding the meaning behind search queries, not just matching keywords.

**Technologies**:
- **spaCy / NLTK**: For text processing and NLP tasks.
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**: For training and deploying machine learning models.
- **OpenCV**: For basic image processing and recognition.

## 4. Data Flow

### File Upload and Processing

1. **User Uploads File**:
   - The user selects a file to upload via the frontend.
   - The frontend sends the file to the **FastAPI backend**, where it is uploaded to **AWS S3** for storage.
   
2. **Metadata Storage**:
   - Metadata (file name, size, type, etc.) is stored in **PostgreSQL** for easy retrieval and indexing.

3. **AI Processing**:
   - The file content is passed through the AI pipeline:
     - **Text files** undergo **NLP** analysis (e.g., summarization).
     - **Images** are processed using **OCR** and **image recognition**.
   
4. **Graph-Based Analysis**:
   - Metadata and file relationships are stored in **Neo4j** for graph-based analysis, enabling semantic search and advanced file relationships.

### Query Handling

1. **User Queries Files**:
   - The user enters a query (e.g., "Show all files related to 'financial report'").
   - The frontend sends the query to the **FastAPI backend**.
   - The backend processes the query, utilizing **semantic search** powered by the **AI layer** and **Neo4j graph database** to find relevant files.

2. **AI Insights**:
   - The AI models analyze the content and relationships between files to return meaningful results, which are then sent back to the frontend.

## 5. Security Considerations

### Data Encryption

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** ensures that all data is encrypted both at rest (in storage) and in transit (during upload/download).
- Files stored in **AWS S3** are encrypted using **AES-256** encryption.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Authentication** is used to securely authenticate users.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ensures that users only have access to files and features they are authorized to interact with.

### Data Isolation

- **Data segregation** ensures that each user's files are stored in isolated environments, preventing unauthorized access between users.
- **AWS IAM roles** are used to manage access to cloud services.
